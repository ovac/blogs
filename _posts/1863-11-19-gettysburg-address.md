###  Hi, I'm Victor Ariama (A.K.A. OVAC4U)! Welcome to my first blog post.

As a lover and contributor to open source and seeing the increased number of visitors on my simple about-me website, I decided it will be fun to have a blog where I could share and sneak peeks, behind the scene pictures, and also to share some technical information, news and probably joke around from time to time. 


### First, let me tell you a little about myself. 

My name is Ariama Victor and I am one of those africans who finds himself wanting to jump at every new web technology I can lay my hands on. I am 23 years ~~old~~ young I'm a final year undergraduate student chasing my bachelor's in business management and computer studies from an elite university in Ghana (Wisconsin International University Colledge).

I was born into a family of 7 (3 kid sisters, one lovely brother and of course my beautiful mother and an elegant father) in Lagos Nigeria. I moved to Ghana in December 2012 and have been based here ever since (It is a beautiful and peaceful country). I do not have much as a hubby because in my spare time, I write codes and every other time, I read, study, and write more codes.

 I hope to use this share views on my porpular phrase dubbed `life of programmer` which is based on my experience and challenges from day to day as an african developer.
 
Please do come around from time to time so that I there'll be someone reading my posts, and I promise to keep the content of this blog rich and interesting.
